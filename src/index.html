      <p class="cs-text">
        A hard money loan is a short-term, asset-based loan used primarily by real estate investors to finance property purchases or renovations. These loans differ from a mortgage, because the loan application is based mainly on property value rather than credit score. As a result, these loans will usually have higher interest rates. They are a good resource for those that need quick financing or who can not qualify for a traditional loan.

      <div class="cs-text">
        <ul>
          <li><span>High returns:</span> Hard money loans usually have higher returns than stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.</li>
          <li><span>Short-term investment:</span> Hard money loans are usually short-term investments. Loan terms range from a few months to a few years. Investors will be able to quickly earn returns on their investment without locking up their money for a long period of time.</li>
          <li><span>Collateralized investment:</span> Hard money loans are collateralized through the borrowerâ€™s property. If a borrower were to default on the loan, the investor can seize the property to recover their investments. As a result, the risk of losing your investment is lowered.</li>
